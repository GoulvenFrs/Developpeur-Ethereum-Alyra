# Getting Started with Voting App

This project need : 

 `npm install --save-dev`

In case of issue instaling, here are the commands I used to create the voting dApp : 
    npx create-react-app voting
    cd voting
    npx hardhat     
    npx hardhat node
    npm install
    npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.12.0" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^2.0.0" "ethers@^5.7.1"
    npm install @openzeppelin/contracts

### For using hardhat

 `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
